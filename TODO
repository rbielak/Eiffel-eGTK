TODO list for eGTK 0.3.5 prepared on July 8th, 2000.
(always check the most recent CVS  to make sure that the stuff wasn't already done).

example/image-scribble-simple
	implement drawing with lines and points

example/range_widget
	extend this example. See main_window.e class

example/test_gtk
	test_gtk.e
		many examples need still to be added as part of testk_gtk
	c_list_cmd.e
		Setting styles and fonts doesn't work right.
	list_remove_selection.e
		extended selection must be done differently 
		maybe. Something seems to be needed with focus_child 
		but I don't understand the code in the C example.
	c_tree_cmd.e
		export tree callback is not done
		setting of styles not done
	c_tree_remove_selection.e
		update counts of pages 
				
lib/egtk

	egtk_widget_factory.e
		widgets are still missing from the factory
	egtk_widget_type_names.e
		complete the name list for all widgets (perhaps generate
		it from C files)

lib/gdk
	gdk_button_press_cmd.e
		is this class used anywhere?
	gdk_button_release_cmd.e
		is this class used anywhere?
	gdk_gc_values.e
		many functions needed to be filled in
	gdk_modifier_type.e
		implement this class
	gdk_motion_command.e
		is this class used anywhere?
	gdk_object.e
		put back exports when SmallEiffel gets its rename/export problem fixed
	gdk_rectangle.e
		If the rectangle is allocated in make, we need to 
		dispose it when this object is collected. Should inherit
		from C_STRUCT for memory management.

lib/glib
	g_list.e
		implement "make_from_widget_array"
		finish "is_equal" routine

lib/gtk
	externals/gtk_style_externals.e
		decide what to do, if anything, about upper bound in get_xxx_gc contracts
	gtk_adjustment.e
		clone/copy for this class must always be "deep"
	gtk_calendar.e
		native GTK calls (UNTESTED) - TODO: replace POINTER types	
		an example of calendar would be useful
	gtk_clist.e
		set_cell_pixmap
			verify that this works together with cell_pixmap 
			routine. Also check whether a gtk_pixmap or gdk_pixmap 
			is to be returned
		column_title_widget
			we need to know what kind of widget this is and build an Eiffel
			object from the GTK+ one.   GtkCList doesn't have this data.

		cell_type and cell_text should probably be replaced along the 
		lines of the routines in GTK_CTREE.  We should set last_text and/or 
		last_pixmap and set a flag to say whether a read was successful.  
		We can then check for pixtext as well.
	gtk_colorsel.e
		native GTK calls (UNTESTED) - replace POINTER types
	gtk_composed_bin.e
		We should now fill children with existing child widgets in
		"make_from_pointer". In invariant check that count should 
		equal the number of child widgets reported by the gtk C library.
	gtk_ctree.e
		set_node_info - not properly implemented.
		get_node_info - should return correct Eiffel object
	gtk_editable.e
		implement "claim_selection"
	gtk_file_selection.e
		make_with_title - use widget factory to create ok/cancel buttons
	gtk_layout.e
		 native GTK calls (UNTESTED) - replace POINTER types
	gtk_main.e
		main_loop_iteration - not sure what the returned value means
	gtk_menu.e
		get_attach_widget
			use widget factory here
	gtk_menu_item.e
		figure out and implement accelerator features
		implement "set_placement"
	gtk_pixmap.e
		in "find_xmp" we should use the path from gtkrc file to find
		the bitmap file
	gtk_radio_menu_item.e
		get rid of the pointers in several make routines.
		"group", "set_group" should use a G_LIST
	gtk_range.e	
		implement trough_click (x, y: INTEGER; jump_perc): INTEGER
		implement default_htrough_click (x, y: INTEGER; jump_perc): INTEGER
		implement default_vtrough_click (x, y: INTEGER; jump_perc): INTEGER
	gtk_scale.e
		add queries
	gtk_text.e
		add text properties
	gtk_tips_query.e
		 native GTK calls (UNTESTED) - replace POINTER types
	gtk_toggle_button.e
		implement the ability to change the button's child,
		whereupon the ugly rename and export{NONE} below can be
		removed.
	gtk_viewport.e
		native GTK calls (UNTESTED) - replace POINTER types
		(use EGTK_WIDGET_FACTORY)
	ise/gtk_command_type.e
		add routines for fetching other kinds of arguments
		Add routines for returning other kinds of values
	ise/gtk_non_portable_calls.e
		Should GC be disabled in "np_make_array_pointer"
		implement "np_gtk_rc_get_default_files"
	se/gtk_non_portable_calls.e
		implement "np_gtk_rc_get_default_files"
	gtk_cell_pixmap.e
		finish a bunch of routines
	gtk_cell_pix_text.e
		implement most of the features
	gtk_cell_widget
		implement most of its features
	gtk_clist_row.e
		cell - routine should be smarter to return right type of cell
		implement most of the other routines

Gnome/Eiffel interface needs a lot of work.
