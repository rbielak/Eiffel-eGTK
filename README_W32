this is for the people interested in getting eGTK running in the Windows environment.


History
=======
- Sven Ehrke, April 17th, 2000
  since eGTK got more and more popular in the Eiffel community I wondered if it
  is possible to get it running under Windows. From some comments (in newsgroups and
  the eGTK readme file it seemed to me that some tries had alreade been undertaken but
  I could not see any information about how to get it really running. Therefore I tried
  to do it myself. It helped me to have both Linux and WindowsNT available so I could
  always look up how it works on Linux and thus try to find a way to get it running on
  Windows as well. And after some struggling I got the hello ($EGTK/examples/hello)
  example running !
  So it seems that it is possible to get eGTK running on Windows.
  I did not try out other examples at the moment. Please report further gained knowledge
  to the eGTK mail group on www.egroups.com or put it to the CVS directory.



Installation
=============
This describes my 'first shot' where my aim was simply to get the 'hello' example running.

gtk+
----
eGTK relies on gtk+. So the first thing we need is gtk+ under Windows. Thanks to
Tor Lillqvist this is already available: http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/
On this site you can get gimp for Windows (which is not important for our current
purpose) and the developer packages (which are important for our purpose).
Download 'glib-dev-yyyymmdd.zip' and 'gtk+-dev-yyyymmdd.zip'. yyyymmdd stands for the
date Tor Lillqvist released the latest version. I used the 20000215 release and I just
saw that 20000416 is out.
Unzip the two files in a directory you like (say 'C:\src\gtk-windows' for this description).

eiffel compiler
---------------
For my first shot I used smalleiffel (you can get it from http://SmallEiffel.loria.fr/)
Here is a small description on how to install it on Windows:
  Extract the se_xxxxxx.tgz file (or however it is called)
  into a folder you like, say "C:\usr" (or some place you like)
  this ends up with the "C:\usr\SmallEiffel" directory.

  - open "C:\usr\SmallEiffel\sys\system.se" and replace "UNIX" with "Windows"
  - Set the Environmentvariable 'SmallEiffel' to 'C:\usr\SmallEiffel\sys\system.se'
  - open a terminal (dos box) in "C:\usr\SmallEiffel" and invoke 'install.exe'
  you are asked to select a compiler:
  use
  - cl if you have installed Microsoft VC++            (!!! for my 'first shot' I used this)
  - lcc if you have this one
  - or gcc if you have it
  - as the install program sys at the end: add "C:\usr\SmallEiffel\bin" to the PATH

  - make sure SmallEiffel works by compiling one of the examples in the show_lib folder.

eGTK
======
release available from http://www.netlabs.net/~richieb/gtk_eiffel.html
or from CVS repository at cvs.debian.org/eiflib (which I used for my try)

unzip/untar it into a directory you like, say 'C:\src\eGTK' and and have a look at
the 'Readme' file. On windows we do the following: set the environment variable
'EGTK' to 'C:\src\eGTK' (if you have the release version of eGTK I think you have
to set also the environment variable 'EIFFEL_GTK' to 'C:\src\eGTK' but I am not sure
about this (EIFFEL_GTK is the former name of eGTK).


Compiling eGTK's C-part
-----------------------
The first thing we need to do (like on Linux) is to compile the C part or eGTK.
A I mentioned before I used Visual C++ to get the hello example running. More work has
to be done to find out how we can use lcc and/or gcc on windows.

So open a command window and cd to %EGTK%\C\se. Create a new batch file called 'cp.bat'
and copy the following text into it:
------------------------- SNIP ----------------
@echo off
set INCLUDES=-I "C:\src\gtk-windows\gtk+" -I "C:\src\gtk-windows\glib" -I "DC:\src\gtk-windows\gtk+\gdk" -I.
cl -c ../eif_gtk.c %INCLUDES%
cl -c ../eif_gdk.c %INCLUDES%
cl -c ../widget_fact.c %INCLUDES%
cl -c eif_gtk_identified.c %INCLUDES%

lib /OUT:eif_gtk.lib *.obj
------------------------- SNIP ----------------
execute cp.bat. This create the library file 'eif_gtk.lib'


Compiling the hello example
---------------------------
cd to %EGTK\examples\hello and create again a batch file called 'cp.bat' with the following content:


------------------------- SNIP ----------------
@echo off

set GTK=C:\src\gtk-windows
set L_EIF_GTK=%EGTK%\C\se\eif_gtk.lib
set L_GLIB=%GTK%\glib\glib-1.3.lib
set L_GDK=%GTK%\gtk+\gdk\gdk-1.3.lib
set L_GTK=%GTK%\gtk+\gtk\gtk-1.3.lib
set L_GMODULE=%GTK%\glib\gmodule-1.3.lib

set LIBS=%L_EIF_GTK% %L_GLIB% %L_GDK% %L_GTK% %L_GMODULE%
set INCLUDES=-I "C:\src\gtk-windows\gtk+" -I "C:\src\gtk-windows\glib" -I "DC:\src\gtk-windows\gtk+\gdk" -I.

compile -o hello2 -no_warning -cecil %EGTK%/C/se/cecil.se hello2 make  %LIBS% %EGTK%/C/se/eif_gtk_se.c %INCLUDES%
------------------------- SNIP ----------------

this should compile (although some warnings appear) and produce an exe file (hello2.exe).
Now copy the following dll's into a directory your PATH points to.

C:\src\gtk-windows\glib\glib-1.3.dll
C:\src\gtk-windows\glib\gmodule-1.3.dll
C:\src\gtk-windows\gtk+\gdk\gdk-1.3.dll
C:\src\gtk-windows\gtk+\gtk\gtk-1.3.dll


Now you should be able to execute hello2.exe and see a small window with a button labled 'Hello World!'.


ToDo (everyone who likes to contribute very welcome)
======================================================
- use cygwin's distribution to be able to 'just' use the shell scripts provided by the eGTK distribution
  (like 'egtkbuild' for example).

- get it running with other C compilers like lcc and gcc

- get it running with ISE Eiffel

- getting the other eGTK examples running

- getting eGlade running
